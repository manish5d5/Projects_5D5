In urban settings, transportation poses a significant challenge, often leading to 
inefficiencies and increased costs for commuters. To address this issue, we propose 
RideShare, a cab booking system that enables users traveling from one location to another 
to share the cost of their journey with fellow travelers. This project aims to enhance 
convenience, affordability, and sustainability in transportation by leveraging technology to 
facilitate ridesharing among users. 
RideShare will be developed using modern web development technologies and APIs. The 
backend will be built using Django, a Python-based framework, coupled with PostgreSQL 
for data storage. Authentication and authorization will be implemented to ensure secure 
access to the platform. Mapping functionalities will be integrated using the Mapbox API to 
enable users to specify pickup and drop-off locations accurately. Real-time communication 
between users will be facilitated through ajax technology, allowing for seamless 
coordination of ridesharing arrangements. 
The implementation of RideShare will result in a user-friendly platform that empowers 
users to find and offer rides conveniently. By enabling users to share the cost of their 
journeys, RideShare will promote cost savings and reduce the environmental impact of 
transportation. Real-time communication features will enhance user experience
